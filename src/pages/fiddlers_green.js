 <p>When a cavalryman dies, he begins a long march to his ultimate destination. About halfway along the road, he enters a broad meadow dotted with trees and crossed by many streams, known as “Fiddler’s Green.” 
</p>
<p>As he crosses the green, he finds an old canteen, a single spur, and a carbine sling. Traveling along, he comes upon a field camp where he finds all the troopers who have gone before him, with their campfires, tents, and picket lines neatly laid out.
</p>
<p>All other branches of service must continue to march without pause. The cavalrymen, though, are authorized to dismount, unsaddle, and stay in the Fiddler’s Green, their canteens ever full, the grass always green, and enjoy the companionship and reminiscences of old friends.
