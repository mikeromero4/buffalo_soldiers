Development & Design Contract

This Contract is between empowering success now (the "Client") and Michael j Romero (the "Contractor").

The Contract is dated [the date both parties sign].

1. WORK AND PAYMENT.

1.1 Project. The Client is hiring the Contractor to do the following: The Contractor will produce a website for the Client with all features and content discussed and agreed upon with the Client prior to the signing of this contract. This includes a custom fully responsive design, development of all pages discussed, free hosting, content management integration, membership payment collection and an e-commerce shop.

1.2 Schedule. The Contractor will begin work on November 26, 2019 and will continue until the work is completed. This Contract can be ended by Client at any time, pursuant to the terms of Section 3, Termination. 

1.3 Changes and revisions
The Contractor will provide 2 free rounds of revisions of reasonable changes requested by Client. ("Reasonable" refers to routine changes such as colors, fonts, moving things around a bit, sizings, etc.) A set of these changes given together constitutes one "round" of changes. At Contractor’s discretion, additional minor changes may be welcome without incurring additional fees. If additional revisions are required, or if a requested revision at that point is considered by Contractor to be significant, major, a new direction, etc., then Contractor will discuss such with Client, as this may incur additional fees.

1.4 Payment. The Client will pay the Contractor a flat fee of $800.00 (USD). Of this, the Client will pay the Contractor $400.00 (USD) before work begins. 

1.5 Invoices. The Contractor will invoice the Client at the end of the project. The Client agrees to pay the amount owed within 15 days of receiving the invoice. Payment after that date will incur a late fee of 5.0% per month on the outstanding amount. 

2. OWNERSHIP AND LICENSES.

2.1 Client Owns All Work Product. As part of this job, the Contractor is creating “work product” for the Client. To avoid confusion, work product is the finished product, as well as drafts, notes, materials, mockups, hardware, designs, inventions, patents, code, and anything else that the Contractor works on—that is, conceives, creates, designs, develops, invents, works on, or reduces to practice—as part of this project, whether before the date of this Contract or after. The Contractor hereby gives the Client this work product once the Client pays for it in full. This means the Contractor is giving the Client all of its rights, titles, and interests in and to the work product (including intellectual property rights), and the Client will be the sole owner of it. The Client can use the work product however it wants or it can decide not to use the work product at all. The Client, for example, can modify, destroy, or sell it, as it sees fit. 

2.2 Contractor’s Use Of Work Product. Once the Contractor gives the work product to the Client, the Contractor does not have any rights to it, except those that the Client explicitly gives the Contractor here.

2.3 Contractor’s Help Securing Ownership. In the future, the Client may need the Contractor’s help to show that the Client owns the work product or to complete the transfer. The Contractor agrees to help with that. For example, the Contractor may have to sign a patent application. The Client will pay any required expenses for this. If the Client can’t find the Contractor, the Contractor agrees that the Client can act on the Contractor’s behalf to accomplish the same thing. The following language gives the Client that right: if the Client can’t find the Contractor after spending reasonable effort trying to do so, the Contractor hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Client as the Contractor’s agent and attorney-in-fact, which appointment is coupled with an interest, to act for the Contractor and on the Contractor’s behalf to execute, verify, and file the required documents and to take any other legal action to accomplish the purposes of paragraph 2.1 (Client Owns All Work Product). 

2.4 Contractor’s IP That Is Not Work Product. During the course of this project, the Contractor might use intellectual property that the Contractor owns or has licensed from a third party, but that does not qualify as “work product.” This is called “background IP.” Possible examples of background IP are pre-existing code, type fonts, properly-licensed stock photos, and web application tools. The Contractor is not giving the Client this background IP. But, as part of the Contract, the Contractor is giving the Client a right to use and license (with the right to sublicense) the background IP to develop, market, sell, and support the Client’s products and services. The Client may use this background IP worldwide and free of charge, but it cannot transfer its rights to the background IP (except as allowed in Section 11.1 (Assignment)). The Client cannot sell or license the background IP separately from its products or services. The Contractor cannot take back this grant, and this grant does not end when the Contract is over. 

2.5 Contractor’s Right To Use Client IP. The Contractor may need to use the Client’s intellectual property to do its job. For example, if the Client is hiring the Contractor to build a website, the Contractor may have to use the Client’s logo. The Client agrees to let the Contractor use the Client’s intellectual property and other intellectual property that the Client controls to the extent reasonably necessary to do the Contractor’s job. Beyond that, the Client is not giving the Contractor any intellectual property rights, unless specifically stated otherwise in this Contract. 

3. Termination
This Agreement may be terminated at any time by either party effective immediately upon notice, or the mutual agreement of the parties. In the event of termination, the Contractor shall be compensated for the services performed through the date of termination in the amount of a prorated portion of the fees due, or (c) hourly fees for work performed by Client as of the date of termination, whichever is greater.

4. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. The Client is hiring the Contractor as an independent contractor. The following statements accurately reflect their relationship:

- The Contractor will use its own equipment, tools, and material to do the work.
- The Client will not control how the job is performed on a day-to-day basis. Rather, the Contractor is responsible for determining when, where, and how it will carry out the work.
- The Client will not provide the Contractor with any training.
- The Client and the Contractor do not have a partnership or employer-employee relationship.
- The Contractor cannot enter into contracts, make promises, or act on behalf of the Client.
- The Contractor is not entitled to the Client’s benefits (e.g., group insurance, retirement benefits, retirement plans, vacation days).
- The Contractor is responsible for its own taxes.
- The Client will not withhold social security and Medicare taxes or make payments for disability insurance, unemployment insurance, or workers compensation for the Contractor or any of the Contractor’s employees or subcontractors. 

5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Neither party is liable for breach-of-contract damages that the breaching party could not reasonably have foreseen when it entered this Contract. 

6. INDEMNITY.
In this Contract, the Client agrees to indemnify the Contractor from and against liabilities, losses, damages, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) related to a third-party claim or proceeding that may arise from the use of the website, content contained or services provided.

7. GENERAL.

7.1 Assignment. This Contract applies only to the Client and the Contractor. The Contractor cannot assign its rights or delegate its obligations under this Contract to a third-party (other than by will or intestate), without first receiving the Client’s written permission. In contrast, the Client may assign its rights and delegate its obligations under this Contract without the Contractor’s permission. This is necessary in case, for example, another Client buys out the Client or if the Client decides to sell the work product that results from this Contract. 

7.2 Arbitration. As the exclusive means of initiating adversarial proceedings to resolve any dispute arising under this Contract, a party may demand that the dispute be resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its commercial arbitration rules. 

7.3 Modification; Waiver. To change anything in this Contract, the Client and the Contractor must agree to that change in writing and sign a document showing their contract. Neither party can waive its rights under this Contract or release the other party from its obligations under this Contract, unless the waiving party acknowledges it is doing so in writing and signs a document that says so. 

7.6 Signatures. The Client and the Contractor must sign this document using Bonsai’s e-signing system. These electronic signatures count as originals for all purposes. 

7.7 Governing Law. The laws of the state of California govern the rights and obligations of the Client and the Contractor under this Contract, without regard to conflict of law principles of that state. 

7.8 Entire Contract. This Contract represents the parties’ final and complete understanding of this job and the subject matter discussed in this Contract. This Contract supersedes all other contracts (both written and oral) between the parties. 

THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE TO THE FOREGOING AS EVIDENCED BY THEIR SIGNATURES BELOW.
