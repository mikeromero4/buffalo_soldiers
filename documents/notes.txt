When a cavalryman dies, he begins a long march to his ultimate destination. About halfway along the road, he enters a broad meadow dotted with trees and crossed by many streams, known as “Fiddler’s Green.” As he crosses the green, he finds an old canteen, a single spur, and a carbine sling. Traveling along, he comes upon a field camp where he finds all the troopers who have gone before him, with their campfires, tents, and picket lines neatly laid out.

All other branches of service must continue to march without pause. The cavalrymen, though, are authorized to dismount, unsaddle, and stay in the Fiddler’s Green, their canteens ever full, the grass always green, and enjoy the companionship and reminiscences of old friends.



<p>
Marching past, all others,
The infantry are seen,
Accompanied by the Engineers,
Artillery and Marine,
For none but the shades of Cavalrymen
Dismount at Fiddler’s Green.
</p>
<p>
Though some go curving down the trail
To seek a warmer scene,
No trooper ever gets to hell
Ere he’s emptied his canteen,
And so rides back to drink again
With friends at Fiddler’s Green…
